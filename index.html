					<h2 id="about">About</h2>
					<p>
						A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the Galactic Empire
						reigned supreme over the galaxy, led by Sith Lord: Emperor
						Palpatine, with his apprentice Darth Vader by his side. Before the
						Galactic Empire assumed control of the galaxy, emperor Palpatine,
						also known as Sheev Palpatine, rose to power as a Senator in the
						Galactic Republic. He then was elected as Supreme Chancellor of the
						Galactic Senate. He then made what can only be described as a great
						leap forward by establishing the Galactic Empire in place of the
						Galactic Republic. The general public generally looks upon the
						Galactic Empire with a negative eye; however, this is only a result
						of propaganda from the Rebels. The Empire was in-fact able to bring
						order to the galaxy, whereas the Rebels fantasized over the
						previously in power Galactic Republic that had a corrupt,
						inefficient government that was unable to free Naboo from the grip
						of the Trade Federation. The American Imperial Faction sees through
						the Rebel propaganda and admires the effectiveness of the Galactic
						Empire in securing order in the galaxy.

					<h2 id="policies">Main Policies</h2>
					<p>
						We model our policies after those that proved to be successful in
						making the Galactic Empire the bastion of galactic order that it
						quickly became upon assuming power.
					</p>
					<div class="indent">
						<h3>Significant Reform of Governmental Structure</h3>
						<p>
							It's obvious that America's current system has tremendously failed
							at bringing order to the country. Inefficient decision-making and
							inaction on many issues is a result of the excessive checks and
							balances. Emperor Palpatine once understood the struggles that
							come with these more Democratically constructed systems as a
							Senator, and later Supreme Chancellor in the Galactic Senate. The
							Galactic Senate proved ineffective in bringing order to the
							galaxy, which is why Supreme Chancellor Palpatine drew the
							applause of the Senators of the Galatic Senate when he announced
							that he was now to become Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic
							Empire. This is why we support...
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The squandering of the ineffective Constitution as it squandered
								the Articles of Confederation before it
							</li>
							<li>The abolition of the judicial and legislative branches</li>
							<li>
								The reformation of the executive branch to follow the concept of
								the Rule of Two:
							</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The Rule of Two is the concept of the Sith that only two Sith
									Lords may exist at any time: One master, and one apprentice
								</li>
								<li>
									The executive branch will consist of one Emperor and an
									apprentice of the Emperor's choosing
								</li>
								<li>
									The Emperor and his apprentice may appoint bureaucrats and
									form bureaucratic organizations as they see fit
								</li>
								<li>This is the most efficient system for decision-making</li>
								<li>
									Any American citizen may replace the Emperor by defeating him
									or her in a duel, after which the new Emperor will appoint
									their apprentice and re-structure the bureaucratic system as
									they please
								</li>
							</ul>
							<li>
								A Unitary system will replace the current federalist system for
								further concentration of power and thus efficient
								decision-making
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Emphasis on Elimination of Threats and Possible Threats</h3>
						<p>
							Emperor Palpatine always cunningly ensured that any terrorists
							were swiftly dealt with, including Separatist leaders such as Nute
							Gunray. Palpatine also carried out the purging of the dangerous
							Jedi Order via Order 66, and his apprentice, Darth Vader,
							proceeded to hunt down survivors of the massacre and any new
							possible threats, including Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Bounty
							hunters such as IG-88, Bossk, and Boba Fett greatly advanced this
							cause. These proceedings most efficiently served to bring order to
							the galaxy. This is why we support...
						</p>
						<li>
							The elimination of terrorist threats regardless of diplomatic
							consequences
						</li>
						<li>
							An exclusive group of the most skilled bounty hunters is to be
							assembled
						</li>
						<li>
							Imperial regulation of locations at which travel occurs
						</li>
						<video controls>

						<h3>Expansion of Military and Increased Benefits for Troopers</h3>
						<p>
							Palpatine utilized his troops effectively to establish law and
							order throughout the galaxy. This is why we support...
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An increase in military spending</li>
							<li>
								Quartering for troopers: Troopers deserve your respect and
								accomodation
							</li>
							<li>Higher wages for troopers</li>
							<li>Pensions for troopers</li>
							<li>
								Integration of a wider variety of combat vehicles into the
								military, including speeders, AT-ATs, and AT-STs
							</li>
							<li>
								Implementation of advertising campaigns for the military to be
								ingrained into the education system
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h2 id="differences">Differences from Republicans and Democrats</h2>
					<p>
						Republicans (the political party, not to be confused with members of
						the Galactic Republic) and Democrats are ineffective parties that
						squabble over futile issues, failing to address blatant needs and
						solve obvious issues. Here is how we differ from them:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Whereas Republicans and Democrats are happy to play their endless
							little political games with each other and engage in ideological
							battles and battles for seats in Congress, we will eliminate
							outside threats and construct a one-party system to avoid the
							impedement of governmental processes
						</li>
						<li>
							Whereas Republicans and Democrats hold primaries and caucuses to
							select the candidates for their parties, if a situation arises, in
							which both the Emperor and his apprentice were to resign or die,
							duels between Emperor hopefuls will occur in each region of the
							country, with electoral votes based on the population of the
							region in which the duel occurs being assigned for each win. The
							candidate with the highest number of electoral votes of all
							surviving candidates will become Emperor. Ties will be resolved by
							duel
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="candidate">Our Candidate</h2>
					<p>
						The candidate the American Imperialist Faction is running for
						President (who after our reforms will become Emperor) is our one and
						only member: Brandon Suen.
					</p>
					<div class="indent">
						<h3>Skilled Dueler</h3>
						<p>
							Like Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, in order to establish
							order, citizens must know that their leader is worthy of office.
							This is why our candidate, Brandon Suen...
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Can do more push-ups than his little sister</li>
							<li>
								Is rated 100/100 strength in GTA
							</li>
							<li>
								Pushed somebody once after a basketball game because the dude
								would not shake his hand after the game
							</li>
							<li>
								Can bench a plate
							</li>
							<li>
								Is pretty okay at Super Smash Bros
							</li>
						</ul>
						<img
							alt="Skilled dueler Brandon Suen"
							class="vertical-image"
							src="./images/skilled-dueler.jpg"
						/>
						<h3>Strong Willed</h3>
						<p>
							Like Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, a leader must be able to
							enforce what is best and impose his or her will on others. This is
							why our candidate, Brandon Suen...
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Broke away from those who now call themselves the 3RD Party upon
								their first signs of disobedience
							</li>
							<li>
								Intimidated Gov teacher into giving him extra credit on Third
								Party PSA (planned)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Works Well Under Pressure</h3>
						<p>
							A leader isn't a true leader if he or she cracks under pressure.
							Before becoming Emperor, Palpatine had the purple lightsaber of
							Mace Windu at his throat; however, Palpatine maintained his
							composure and was able to maneuver himself out of the tight
							situation, resulting in Windu's death instead of his own. This is
							why our candidate, Brandon Suen...
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Programmed this entire website from scratch the day before the
								due date of the project
